Description:
------------------------------
This file comprises 2 programs that act as a TCP server application and a TCP client application to send and received text data and storing it on a local text file.
The client and server has been modified to implement a new TCP based protocol. The server has been updated to support multiple clients and take advantage of threading using Pthreads.
HINT: The portnumbers and addresses should be hardcoded into the program.

------------------------------
Build:
/~ make all//this create the executables server and client.
/~ make test creates all the clients to test code with
/~ make server //this create the executable for server only.
/~ make client //this makes the executable for the client only.
/~ make clean //removes the executables from the directory
------------------------------
Run:
cd into the "bin" directory.

1. ./server
2. ./client
3. Run script via chmoding the script and running it after ./script
